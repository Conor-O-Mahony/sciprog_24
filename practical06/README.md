# Practical 5

## Exercise 1

To compile and run

```bash
make
./prog
```

Multiplies the matricies
```math
C_{n*q} = A_{n*p} * B_{p*q}
```
Where $n=5$, $p=3$, $q=4$, $A_{ij} = i + j$ and $B_{ij} = i - j$, and displays the result. The file matmult.c contains the function for multiplying two matricies and main.c contains the code for printing the results.
